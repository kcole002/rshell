# rshell

We were having problems creating a bin folder when the project was built. We couldn't implement this part of the assignment

Also, since out program continually asks for input until the user input 'exit'. We included 'exit' as an input line for our test cases. this was so that we can nptify the user on what was being tested before we actually ran individual tests.

We couldn't get our Makefile to access the src directory to compile our program, so our test cases require a Makefile to also be in the src directory.
